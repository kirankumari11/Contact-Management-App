# Contact-Management-App
Developed a secure RESTful API that allows users to create, update, delete, and view their own contacts. Implemented user authentication and authorization using JWT and password encryption with bcrypt, ensuring data privacy. Used MongoDB for data storage and Express.js for efficient routing and middleware handling.
